SPEAKER_02 - We heard earlier about George W. Bush, who during his presidency was, of course, known for his verbal gaffes or Bushisms.
SPEAKER_02 - I'm going to read you some quotes, and I want you to tell me if they were said by George W. Bush or by another politician. If both correctly identify the answer, tell me which one said the correct answer first.
SPEAKER_02 -  There are a few of these, so we're going to go quick fire.

SPEAKER_02 - I would.
SPEAKER_02 - And I'm sure I have on the podcast and it's just been edited out by Harriet.
